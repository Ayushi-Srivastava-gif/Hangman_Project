#**Hereâ€™s a step-by-step description of how a Hangman game works:**

1.**Choose a Word**: One player (or the program in a single-player version) selects a word and keeps it hidden.
2.**Setup**: The game displays a series of blanks representing each letter of the word. For example, if the word is "PYTHON", the display would be "_ _ _ _ _ _".
3.**Guessing Letters**: The guessing player suggests letters one at a time.
4.**Correct Guess**: If the guessed letter is in the word, all instances of the letter are revealed in the correct positions. For example, if the word is "PYTHON" and the player guesses "O", the display would update to "_ _ _ _ O _".
5.**Incorrect Guess**: If the guessed letter is not in the word, a part of a hangman is drawn (e.g., head, body, arms, legs). The number of incorrect guesses allowed is usually limited (commonly 6).
6.**Win/Lose**: The game continues until the player guesses the word correctly (win) or runs out of guesses (lose).
